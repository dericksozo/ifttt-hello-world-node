# ifttt-hello-world-node
A Hello World Service for IFTTT built using Node.js and Express.

## Getting started
First, clone this directory. `cd` into the folder, and run `npm install`. After all the dependences have finished installing, run `node index`. That will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`. Finally, use Forward or Ngrok to forward that address to the internet. Insert the generated URL into your IFTTT Service API url for testing purposes.
